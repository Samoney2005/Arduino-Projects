# Arduino Projects Repository  
**Personal Microcontroller-Based Projects**

## Overview  
This repository contains personal Arduino projects that explore various electronics, hardware interfacing, and embedded programming concepts. These projects are designed to enhance hands-on experience with microcontrollers and real-world hardware applications.

## Key Concepts  
In these projects, you will find implementations and experimentation involving:

- **Microcontroller Programming (Arduino C/C++)**  
- **Sensor Integration (temperature, motion, humidity, etc.)**  
- **Actuator Control (LEDs, motors, servos, relays)**  
- **Serial Communication (UART, I2C, SPI)**  
- **Circuit Design & Prototyping (breadboarding, schematic planning)**  
- **Real-Time Input/Output Handling**  
- **Power Management (batteries, voltage regulation)**  
- **Embedded Systems Debugging & Optimization**

## Projects Included  
- Trick Switch Alarm System  
- Environmental Data Logger  
- Servo Motor Controller  
- LED Pattern Controller with Pushbutton  
- Vibration Feedback Device  
- SD Card Storage Module Integration

## Tools Used  
- **Arduino UNO, ESP32, D1 Mini**  
- **Arduino IDE / PlatformIO**  
- **Breadboards, jumper wires, resistors, capacitors**  
- **Various modules: DHT11, SG90 Servo, MicroSD Module, Vibration Motor**
